## Tidying Data 

First steps:
* import data for all years
* join files
  * join data frames accross years
  * join data frames accross types
* write to csv and place in project for reproducability 
* write code to import data
* recode categorical variables with nhanes codebook

### Initial Plot 1

General Audience
Goal: Show the trend in substance use from 2005 to 2015 by different substances and explore gender and racial differences
Variables: Substance use is the count of the number of people who reported use in that year

  filter(cocaine == "Yes")

  select(year, Heroin, Cocaine, Meth, Marijuana) %>% 
  gather(drug, n, Heroin:Marijuana) 

ggplot(su_count, aes(year, n)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = drug))

# Shaina I made some changes to improve the plot you created here. I really enjoyed the gathering to create the drug variable. I changed your x axis to make it where it doesn't have the decimal but changed the years because I thought it looked better at every two years. I also removed the legend and used the ggrepel (sorry if you need to download it) package to use names rather than the legend. I believe there might be a better way to show the names. I also changed the colors for something that might be better for color blindness. - JP

```

Changes to make for revision:
* filter out marijuana to visualize illicit drugs per proposal
  * fct_reorder drug levels so that colors match order presented
  * annotate labels instead of legend - Since lines are so far apart, place label at end of trend line and delete the legend (will have to expand y limits)
* Change count to percent
  * increased cognitive load - small increases and harder to understand proportion
* edit x axis to show years more clearly
* make lines thicker, change color pallete
* Place points for the years in there is data for
* try facet by sex or ethnicity
  * stack vertically on top of each other (wont work with annotated labels)
  * change aspect ratio
* modify theme elements and place labels to reduce cognitive load
  * only major gridlines with data shown
  * Bigger facet titles
  * Adding labels
    * get rid of x axis since it is clear it is year
  * add space between y label and axis
  * center title
  * lighten axis text and caption
* Identify dips and rises in trends and search for reasons why (policy, etc)
  * Nov 2012 recreational marijuana legalized
  * Obama ends war on drugs in 2009
* Find best aspect ratio
* tidy data differently
  * get one dataset without joining
  * filter for data, gather, group_by, and count
* FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLACE ANNOTATES AT DIFFERENT POINTS ON FACETS AND GET WHITE BACKGROUND BEHIND ANNOTATE TEXT.

# This revised plot is amazing. My only comment for a change on this plot would be to change the color from gray30 to black since the dotted line is a little difficult to see. I changed the color and made your dotted line a dotdash line so its a little easier to see. I also added the + after your labs to incorporate your OkabeIto color pallette. I think it is a little easier on the eyes after my small changes but this plot is very informative and will make me go back to my code and incorporate some of the changes in my own plots. - JP

### Initial Plot 2

Scientific Audience
Goal: Show the change in distribution of how many days a person used different addictive benzodiazepines from year 2001 to 2015
Variables: days of use is continuous and types of benzodiazepines and year is categorical

```{r plot2_data}
pud1 <- pu %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(rxddrug == "LORAZEPAM" |
         rxddrug == "ALPRAZOLAM" |
         rxddrug == "DIAZEPAM" |
         rxddrug == "CLONAZEPAM") %>% 
  select(seqn, rxddrug, rxddays, rxdcount) %>% 
  rename(drug = rxddrug,
         days = rxddays, 
         count = rxdcount)

to_join <- t_demo %>% 
  rename(age = ridageyr) %>% 
  select(seqn, year, age, sex) 

pud <- left_join(pud1, to_join, by = "seqn") %>% 
  naniar::replace_with_na(replace = list(days = 99999)) %>% 
  mutate(year = factor(year))
  
```


```{r initial_plot2}
ggplot(pud, aes(drug, days)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = year))
```

To refine:
* change to ridgeline density to clearly see them since so much overlap
* add variability with jitter
  * added jittered points
* change drug names to generic names for non-medical scientists 
  * change case of drug categories
* change days to years 
  * limit x axis to 0 on ggridges (never less than 0 years)
* change scale of ridges to to get less overlap and see jittered points better
* professional color pallete
* get rid of legend if adding color
* limit data to those under 80
* extend aspect ratio - wider for the years
* add facet boxes
* fct reorder density plots

```{r refined_plot2_NOTUSING}
rpud <- pud %>% 
  mutate(use_yr = days/365) %>% 
  filter(age != 80)

ggplot(rpud, aes(use_yr, fct_reorder(drug, use_yr), fill = drug)) +

                   labels = c("Ativan", "Klonopin", "Valium", "Xanax")) + # or delete and change case str_to_title and use specific name?

       caption = "Data from the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

2ND Revision:
* change color to white to not get rideline where there is no data (0 on x)
* change facet to drug to see differences in years more clearly
  * facet by drug type and put year on y axis, so it is easier to see differences between the years over the drug types
* figure out how to change point color to black to see actual distribution of points

# The final plot shows so much more information in a visually appealing manner. My only comment and potential contribution is to change your years to have 2001 before 2015. The code is above your ggplot to change the years. It could have also been piped inot your code too. -JP

### Initial Plot 3

Audience: Scientific community
Goal: Show how age of first substance use differs by income for each substance type
Variables: age of first substance use is categorical, income and substance types are categorical

```{r initial_plot 3}
pd <- d %>% 
  rename(age_Marijuana = duq210, 
         age_Cocaine = duq260, 
         age_Heroin = duq300, 
         age_Meth = duq340) %>% 
  filter(year != 2005) %>% 
  select(age_Cocaine, age_Marijuana, age_Heroin, age_Meth, income, sex, ethnicity, sex) %>% 
  gather(drug, age_use, age_Cocaine:age_Meth) %>% 
  separate(drug, c(NA, "drug"), sep = "_") %>% 
  drop_na(age_use)

ggplot(pd, aes(income, age_use)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = sex), position = "dodge") + #barely any sex differences
  facet_wrap(~ drug)
  
```

For Revision:
* take out sex since there are barely any differences
* create one average value to plot instead of distribution
* condense income levels
* have drug type on x axis and facet by income level (see crimes in denver hw2code)
* change colors and theme layout
* think of other type of graph (have point estimate with st. error since calculating average)
* fct_reorder levels
* take out marijana? illicit use
* filter out and combine income levels
* relevel income levels from lowest to highest
* filter out age of use that are coded as missing or denied
* calculate mean to plot instead of whatever is plotted above
* make error bars for uncertainty
  * calculate se for mean of age of use

#can't really see differences - make jitter with point estimate and se bar

```

2nd revise:

* plot jittered raw distribution with point and uncertaintly over it
* plot using only 2 years recent data for less overlap/confounds
* add label for average age
* could try stat density

# I think the black background does a better job of showing the distribution of your points. The color use really shows that cocaine is used more and as the amount of points for cocaine is much more dense than the other drugs. I did make one change for this plot. When you changed the color of the background, you did not change the colors of the facet wrapped drug names. I just included that and had the color is gray90. You can change it to whatever color you want. -JP

# add labels for average age since limiting x axis

# I don't really have any changes to propose. I think this is just an awesome plot. My only comment would be to either change the color of the average age or to move it over slightly more to the right. Overall, I like the way this plot is already. I also wonder if changing your x-axis scale to 30 would make this a stronger plot. -JP
